# Introduction

Bronzite.js is a discord.js framework. It is a collection of useful tools and features that can be used to create a discord.js bot.
In order to use it, you need to install it. Installing discord.js is also required.

```bash npm2yarn2pnpm
npm install @bronzitejs/framework discord.js
```

Now you can use the framework. We'll get to that in the next doc.
